## Why?
I want to actually develop something that might be useful, 
and something that's actually finished, since so many
of my projects just get slapped into `/dev/null`.

## Hopeful goals for this language
- [ ] Compiled
- [ ] Easy C interop
- [ ] Self hosted
- [ ] Errors that help people new people to learn the language (instead of just looking at examples)
